# Missing Audio Synthesis Methods

SSOT for synthesis methods NOT yet implemented. Minimal descriptions—research as needed.

---

## Low Complexity

- **Phase Distortion** — warp waveform phase over time (Casio CZ)
- **AM** — amplitude modulation between oscillators
- **Ring Modulation** — multiply two signals, sum/difference frequencies

---

## Medium Complexity

- **PM** — phase modulation (DX7's actual algorithm)
- **Feedback FM** — operator self-modulation
- **Waveshaping (synthesis)** — transfer function as sound source
- **Modal** — resonant filter bank for struck/bowed objects

---

## High Complexity

- **Vector** — 2D/3D crossfade between multiple sources
- **Vocoder** — spectral envelope transfer (carrier/modulator)
- **Spectral/FFT** — frequency domain manipulation
- **Formant** — vowel/voice synthesis via resonant filter banks
- **Waveguide** — bidirectional delay physical modeling

---

## Research-Grade

- **Stochastic/GENDYN** — probability-driven synthesis (Xenakis)

- **Mass-Spring** — physical simulation of connected masses
- **Finite Element** — full physics sim of vibrating bodies
- **Concatenative** — corpus-based grain matching
- **FOF** — formant wave function (IRCAM singing synthesis)
- **PAF** — phase aligned formant
- **VOSIM** — voice simulation via pulse trains
