# Missing Audio Synthesis Methods

SSOT for synthesis methods NOT yet implemented. Minimal descriptions—research as needed.

---

## Low Complexity

- **AM** — amplitude modulation between oscillators
- **Ring Modulation** — multiply two signals, sum/difference frequencies
- **Phase Distortion** — warp waveform phase over time (Casio CZ)

---

## Medium Complexity

- **Modal** — resonant filter bank for struck/bowed objects (bells, chimes, metal)
- **Vocoder** — spectral envelope transfer (carrier/modulator)

---

## High Complexity

- **Formant** — vowel/voice synthesis via resonant filter banks (creature sounds)
- **Vector** — 2D/3D crossfade between multiple sources (evolving textures)
