# SpecCade TODOs (Curated Backlog)

## Music

- Prefer `TrackerInstrument.ref` (external `audio_v1` specs) in music examples/goldens so instruments are reusable and specs stay small; keep inline synthesis only when demonstrating a feature.
- Add a higher-quality drum example (filtered noise / metallic synthesis and/or WAV drum samples) and tune it by ear so kick/snare/hat sound correct in common XM/IT players.
- Add a small “XM vs IT parity” listening checklist and automate basic structural checks (loop flags/envelope flags) in tests.
