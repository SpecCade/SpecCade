# SpecCade - Claude Code Instructions

This file is intentionally thin to avoid duplicating project guidance.

## Read First

- `AGENTS.md` (canonical agent notes + SSOT map)
- `README.md` (how to install/run)
- `docs/README.md` (docs map)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (crate map + determinism model)
- `PARITY_MATRIX.md` (tier guarantees)

## Local Development

If `speccade` is not installed, use:

- `cargo run -p speccade-cli -- <args>`

Avoid treating RFCs and old plan docs as authoritative unless `docs/ROADMAP.md` points to them.
